# Campus-Network-Design
Designed and implemented a scalable 3-tier campus network architecture using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network features core, distribution, and access layers with built-in redundancy and dynamic routing via RIP v2. Configured VLANs for logical segmentation, inter-VLAN routing, and trunk links for efficient traffic flow.
